## Visual question answering (VQA) approach to explaining autonomous driving actions

In this repository, we provide a preliminary study of explainable self-driving actions using a question-answering approach. The goal is that, given a question and action performed by a self-driving car within a driving scene, the VQA framework should provide a correct and intelligible justification (i.e., answer) for that chosen action.  

## Setup

Firstly, we need to get the MS COCO files. In order to get the MS COCO files, we need to go to  the ``` src/utilities``` folder and execute ``` download_and_unzip_datasets.csh ```. The commands inside this script file will download the MS COCO images.
